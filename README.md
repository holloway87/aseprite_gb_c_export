Aseprite GameBoy C Export
=========================

This is an Aseprite script to export the image from the current active
sprite to C source code to use it with GBDK.

You can find the scripts folder via the menu
"File -> Scripts -> Open Scripts Folder".

Copy the .lua file in there and rescan the scripts folder from Aseprite
to use it.

Limitations
-----------

At the moment this script only supports the grayscale palette, I will
hopefully add support for CGB color palettes later.
